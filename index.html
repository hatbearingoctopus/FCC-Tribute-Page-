			<h1 id="tribute-info">Biography:</h1>
			<p>Born December 9th, 1906 Grace Hopper was to become an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. She is most well known for being among the first computer programmers. Being a pioneer in the industry lead to her being one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark 1 computer as well as inventing one of the first compiler related tools. The idea of machine independent programming languages was made popular by Hopper which lead to the development of the early programming language COBOL. COBOL is still in use today and is primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments. Grace passed away in her sleep from natural causes on January 1st, 1992. She was 85 years young. Without Grace Hoppers early contributions to programming the computer and tech industry would not be nearly as advanced as it is today.
